# Audio generation parameters
audio_generation:
  exaggeration: 0.6 # Controls how 'emotional' or 'creative' the audio will be. Lower values tend towards monotonous, predictable output. Higher values produce varied, emotionally dynamic outputs. 0.5 is a good starting value.
  temperature: 0.8 # Recommend to leave it at 0.8
  cfg_weight: 0.5 # Roughly controls 'variability' and 'pacing' of the audio. Lower values slow it down, keep it more even. Higher values speed it up, make it more dynamic. 0.5 is a good starting value.
  seed: 4000 # Seed for reproducibility. 0 is randomized.
